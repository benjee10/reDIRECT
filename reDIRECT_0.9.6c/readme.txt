reDIRECT v0.9.6c. 
PHASE THREE

KSP version: 1.6.1 (1.3.1+ supported)

Release Date: 14-01-2019.

Created by BENJEE10. 

Thank you for downloading reDIRECT, a revamp of the DIRECT mod which introduces shuttle-derived parts for Kerbal Space Program. 

This release includes parts required for a Shuttle stack and the Jupiter family of rockets, as well as the Orion spacecraft.  

INSTALLATION:

Simply drag and drop the "reDIRECT" folder into your KSP gameData directory. 

DEPENDECIES:

B9PartSwitch and Community Resource Pack are bundled with this mod. You may need to update B9PartSwitch for the mesh switching features to function in newer versions of Kerbal Space Program. 

CRAFT FILES:

The following craft files are bundled with this download:

	ORION SPACECRAFT
	Orion crew vehicle + launch escape system.

	ARES I
	Two-stage launch vehicle with 5-segment SRB as 1st stage & 3.125m upper stage. Orion Capsule payload. 

	JUPITER 130 - Crew
	Two-stage 5m Launch Vehicle with three engines on the first stage, two 4-segment SRBs. Orion Capsule payload. 

	JUPITER 240 - Crew
	Three-stage 5m Launch Vehicle with four engines on the first stage, two 4-segment SRBs, & 6-engine upper stage. Orion Capsule payload. 

Craft files should be put in the Kerbal Space Program/Ships/VAB/ directory, or into the relevant subfolder of your save file. 
PLEASE NOTE: these craft will be generally overpowered for a stock-sized Kerbin system. For the most realistic balance I recommend using a 2.4x or 3.2x solar system rescale.
